    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <div class="project-description">
        The assignment was to recreate a 2D sidescroller/platformer. Which better game to choose than Kirby! Super Stars has been a personal favorite so I didn't want to miss out on this opportunity and gave it my best, considering the little knowledge I had back then.</br>
        </br>
        This project displays how much I've learned over the years and how far we can get with some dedication. It also reminds me to not abuse OOP. Planning ahead in terms of time and project structure is an important lesson learned.
