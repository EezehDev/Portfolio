        Charlie The Wizard is looking for a new wand to equip. Will finding one fulfil his destiny? Play till the end to find out! </br>
        </br>
        This was my first game jam, which was both an exciting and nerve wracking experience. Over the course of the jam I learned a lot about: managing time, planning, dividing work, communication and what teamwork is about. This first experience got me hooked and motivated to make more games and join more game jams.

            Weapons can be picked up by clicking near them, using a combination of raycast and spherecast. Upon releasing the mouse button, Charlie the wizard throws the weapon forward.</br>
            </br>
            Each weapons interacts differently:
            <ul class="dot-list">
                <li>Shield can bounce off walls and enemies</li>
                <li>Sword pierces through multiple foes</li>
                <li>Axe flies in an arc and makes a big impact</li>
            </ul></br>
            The AI is implemented using Nav Mesh Agents, damaging the player when they get too close.
